# MPI design pattern 1

## MPI design patten : DoGatherMaster

Often times I have a requirement to implement some repeated design patterns in MPI that time and again come in one form or other. I am going to abstract them in C++11 for reuse of the design pattern and avoid problems with code maintenance. The first patten that I will discuss is the **DoGatherMaster** primitive.
